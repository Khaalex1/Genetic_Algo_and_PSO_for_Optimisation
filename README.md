# GA and PSO for optimisation

Authors : Alexandre Kha and RaphaÃ«l Valeri

This repository implements two well-known optimization algorithms, PSO (Particle Swarm
Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) from scratch (without using specific optimization library)
designed during a coursework of the Biologically Inspired Computation course at Heriot-Watt University.

## Code running 

To run the code you can execute the following command
    python main.py
    This will run the PSO algorithm on the Rastrigin function with default values for the hyperparameters

To access the documentation of this execution you can run the following command:
    python main.py -h

If you want to use the GA you can run with the option --ga
    python main.py --ga
    python main.py --pso for PSO

If you want to use one specific fitness function among Rosenbrock, Rastrigin and Griewank you need to add
respectively the option f1, f2 or f3
e.g.
    python main.py --ga -f1

Other options are available:
    -k with a number to run k-repeated run
    -p to plot the evolution of the optimization by the PSO algorithm if used

If you want to modify the values of the hyperparameters, you need to change their values at the beginning of the
main.py script (first, the values for the PSO are set and then the ones of GA)

Note that you can visualize the swarm of a PSO algorithm in a continuous contour plot when the dimension is 2. You can try to
replace the value of the field 'dimension' in the main.py file by two.


It is also possible to run the programs directly from the GA_class.py and PSO.py files, however the user may know the signification of the parameters (examples are provided in the "main" section though).

## Implementation details and results

For more details about the implementation and results, please see functions documentation and coursework report pdf.
Note that the GA is particularly fast, which is due to the use of matrix (numpy array) formalism when possible. In an actual blackbox optimisation problem, it might not be necessarily possible to use this representation.
